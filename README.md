# C++ Training Project

This is my personal C++ learning journey. The repository is dedicated to learning the C++ programming language from the ground up.

I created this project for myself as a hands-on way to really learn by doing. Instead of passively watching tutorials, I found it much more effective to actively write code, document my understanding, and build small projects. Maybe it could be useful for somebody else trying to navigate in the C++ jungle.

## Project Structure

My learning path is divided into 4 steps. Each step builds on the last, progressing from basic syntax to more complex topics and modern C++ practices.

# Roadmap

## Setup for C++ Development
#### IDE: Visual studio, VS Code, Clion, Xcode, etc.
#### Compiler: g++, MSVC, Clang, etc.

###  Step 1: The Basics
> **Goal:** Learn basic syntax, data types, variables, decision making & Loops.

- [X] Learn the basics what C++ is and how it works. `Compiler`, `Machine code`, `Pointers`, `Memory Management` etc.
- [X] Understand basic C++ syntax `main()`, `#include`, `namespaces`, `std::cout`, `std::cin`
- [X] Learn data types: `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`, `std::string`
- [X] Set variables to the data types: int `variable` = 1; etc.
- [X] Practice decision making: `if`, `else`, `else if`, `Switch`,  logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- [X] Learn loops: `for`, `while`, `do-while`
- [X] Create small console programs to use decision making & loops.
- [X] Create a mini project combining everything I have learned in step 1.

###  Step 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
> **Goal:** Learn how to structure code using classes and objects.

- [ ] Define custom classes with attributes and methods
- [ ] Use constructors and destructors
- [ ] Understand `private` vs `public` access modifiers
- [ ] Learn basic inheritance and polymorphism
- [ ] Use the `this` keyword
- [ ] Practice `const` correctness in methods and parameters

---

###  Step 3: Intermediate Concepts
> **Goal:** Deepen understanding of memory and C++ mechanics.

- [ ] Master pointers (`*`, `&`) and dynamic memory allocation (`new`, `delete`)
- [ ] Use common STL containers: `std::vector`, `std::map`, `std::array`
- [ ] Understand references and reference passing
- [ ] Learn function pointers and lambda expressions
- [ ] Handle errors with `try/catch` and exceptions
- [ ] Work with `enum`, `struct`, and `typedef`

---

###  Step 4: Modern C++ and Real-World Structure
> **Goal:** Use modern language features and write scalable code.

- [ ] Use modern syntax: `auto`, range-based `for`, `nullptr`, `using`
- [ ] Smart pointers: `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`
- [ ] Organize code across `.h` (headers) and `.cpp` (source files)
- [ ] Create simple terminal-based applications
- [ ] Use Makefiles or CMake to build multi-file projects

## Learning Tips

- Use AI as a learning companion ‚Äî ask questions, get code reviewed, explore ideas ‚Äî **don't use it to write code** (especially as a beginner).
- Learn all the basics really good before start with something advanced or a framework.
- Don't copy and paste ‚Äî write code from scratch to fully understand how it works.
- Try to explain what you're learning in your own words.
- Create a repo or a document to track your progress.

##  Mini Projects to Practice

Try building small projects to reinforce what you‚Äôve learned:

-  Console calculator
-  To-do list using arrays or vectors
-  Number guessing game
-  File read/write program
-  Class-based student or contact management system

---

## üèÅ Final Objective

By the end of this roadmap, I aim to:

- Write clean, efficient, and maintainable C++ code
- Understand memory management, object lifetimes, and references
- Build small to mid-sized C++ projects with confidence
- Be fully prepared to work with advanced frameworks in the future
