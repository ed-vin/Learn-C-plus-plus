# C++ Training Project

This is my personal C++ learning journey. The repository is dedicated to learning the C++ programming language from the ground up — one step at a time.

I created this project for myself as a hands-on way to really *learn by doing*. Instead of passively watching tutorials, I found it much more effective to actively write code, document my understanding, and build small projects. Maybe it could be useful for somebody else trying to navigate in the C++ jungle.

## Learning Tips

- Use AI as a learning companion — ask questions, get code reviewed, explore ideas — **don't use it to write code** (especially as a beginner).
- Consistency matters more than intensity: 30 minutes a day > 4 hours once a week.
- Learn all the basics before start with something advanced or a framework.
- Don't copy and paste — write code from scratch to build muscle memory.
- Explain what you're learning in your own words — teaching reinforces understanding.
- Create a repo or a document to track your progress.

## Project Structure

This learning path is divided into 4 steps. Each step builds on the last, progressing from basic syntax to more complex topics and modern C++ practices.

## 📅 Roadmap

### Step 0: Set up for C++ Development
#### IDE: Visual studio, VS Code, Clion, Xcode, etc.
#### Compiler: g++, etc.

### ✅ Step 1: The Basics
> **Goal:** Learn basic syntax, data types, I/O, and control flow.

- [X] Learn what C++ is and how it works. 
- [X] Understand `main()`, `#include`, `std::cout`, `std::cin`
- [X] Learn primitive types: `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`, `std::string`
- [X] Practice control flow: `if`, `else`, `else if`, `Switch`,  logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- [ ] Learn loops: `for`, `while`, `do-while`
- [ ] Write simple functions and understand parameters/returns
- [ ] Practice writing clean, well-commented code

---

### ✅ Step 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
> **Goal:** Learn how to structure code using classes and objects.

- [ ] Define custom classes with attributes and methods
- [ ] Use constructors and destructors
- [ ] Understand `private` vs `public` access modifiers
- [ ] Learn basic inheritance and polymorphism
- [ ] Use the `this` keyword
- [ ] Practice `const` correctness in methods and parameters

---

### ✅ Step 3: Intermediate Concepts
> **Goal:** Deepen understanding of memory and C++ mechanics.

- [ ] Master pointers (`*`, `&`) and dynamic memory allocation (`new`, `delete`)
- [ ] Use common STL containers: `std::vector`, `std::map`, `std::array`
- [ ] Understand references and reference passing
- [ ] Learn function pointers and lambda expressions
- [ ] Handle errors with `try/catch` and exceptions
- [ ] Work with `enum`, `struct`, and `typedef`

---

### ✅ Step 4: Modern C++ and Real-World Structure
> **Goal:** Use modern language features and write scalable code.

- [ ] Use modern syntax: `auto`, range-based `for`, `nullptr`, `using`
- [ ] Smart pointers: `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`
- [ ] Organize code across `.h` (headers) and `.cpp` (source files)
- [ ] Create simple terminal-based applications
- [ ] Use Makefiles or CMake to build multi-file projects

## 💡 Mini Projects to Practice

Try building small projects to reinforce what you’ve learned:

- 🧮 Console calculator
- 📝 To-do list using arrays or vectors
- 🔢 Number guessing game
- 📂 File read/write program
- 👥 Class-based student or contact management system

---

## 🏁 Final Objective

By the end of this roadmap, I aim to:

- Write clean, efficient, and maintainable C++ code
- Understand memory management, object lifetimes, and references
- Build small to mid-sized C++ projects with confidence
- Be fully prepared to work with advanced frameworks in the future
